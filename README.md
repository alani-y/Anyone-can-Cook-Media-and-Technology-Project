🎬 Cardboard Ratatouille 🍽️
Welcome to the official GitHub repository for Cardboard Ratatouille, a loving (and low-budget) recreation of Ratatouille using only cardboard, creativity, and code!

📜 About
This project aims to bring Ratatouille to life in the most DIY way possible—by recreating the film using cardboard cutouts, stop-motion animation, and a bit of coding magic. Whether you're here to contribute, watch, or just admire the absurdity, you're in for a treat!

🛠️ Tech Stack
While most of the magic happens with scissors and glue, here's the tech that makes it all work:
Arduino to control the servos
C++ for programming the Arduino
